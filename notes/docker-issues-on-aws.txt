debug docker issues on aws
------------------------------------

If container has failed, how do you find the problem?

- you can get some high level info about why it failed from the 'Task' area of the AWS Console
- beyond that, ssh into the ec2 instance that is the container instance
- then investigate what happened


`docker ps`    	
To get running containers


`docker ps -a`	
To get previous running containers


`docker exec -it [container id] bash` 
To get into the running container


`docker logs [container id]`
To look at logs
