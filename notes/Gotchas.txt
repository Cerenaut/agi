This is stuff you need to know for running experiments.
The gotcha's.

If using Postgres separate database:
DB Host
---------------------
DB_HOST env variable needs to be set in the shell environment of the python script
If the script is run on one machine, and launches the task on AWS, then it must be done from outside of script. Therefore, it is in variables-docker.sh, but set by the python script explicitly by python script for local execution (which requires it to be commented out locally in variables.)
