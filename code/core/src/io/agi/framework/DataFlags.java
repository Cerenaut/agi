/**
 * Flags that modify the persistence behaviour of the framework. The aim is to reduce IO and yield a faster overall
 * update. Since the framework is heavily IO bound, this makes a big difference.
 * <p/>
 * Supported flags are:
 * <p/>
 * - Lazy persist: This will check for changes and only persist if changed. There is a cost: We need to keep a copy of
 * the old value of the data, and compare them. If you rarely change a data structure, then add this flag.
 * <p/>
 * - Node cache: If you do not expect / allow external writes of the data, you can cache it in the Node. This avoids the
 * need to load the data every time, but it means you won't see external changes. Use this flag when nothing else will
 * change your data.
 * <p/>
 * - Sparse unit: This reduces the serialized size of the data. Use it whenever you have sparse unit data (i.e. all
 * values are binary and there are few '1' bits.
 * <p/>
 * - Persist only: This data is never fetched. It is written for the consumption of external entities or debugging. The
 * Entity must be regenerating it from other data.
 * <p/>
 * - Persist on flush: The data is only persisted when a flush occurs.
